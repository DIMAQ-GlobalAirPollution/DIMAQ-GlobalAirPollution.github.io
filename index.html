		<div>ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL FINE PARTICULATE MATTER AIR POLLUTION (PM2.5) FOR 2010-2019</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Air pollution is a major risk factor for global health, with both ambient and household air pollution contributing substantial components of the overall global disease burden. One of the key drivers of adverse health effects is fine particulate matter ambient (outdoor) pollution (PM2.5) to which an estimated 4.2 million deaths can be attributed annually. Together with household air pollution, it is estimated that globally 6.9 million deaths can be attributable to air pollution annually. 
</div>
		<div>Assessment of the global effects of air pollution requires a comprehensive set of estimated exposures for all populations. The primary source of information for estimating exposures has been measurements from ground monitoring networks but, although coverage is increasing, there remain regions in which monitoring is limited. 

Ground monitoring data therefore needs to be supplemented with information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth, chemical transport models. In addition to these estimates of air quality, other information can be used in estimating air pollution, including population estimates and topography (e.g. elevation). The Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) was developed by the WHO Data Integration Task Force to integrate data from multiple sources in order to provide estimates of exposures to PM2.5 at high spatial resolution globally. 
Sources of data include ground measurements from over 11,000 monitoring locations around the world from the WHO cities database together with satellite remote sensing, chemical transport models, reanalysis of air pollution forecasts, population estimates, topography, and information on local monitoring networks and information on specific components of fine particulate air pollution.
It is estimated that over 99% of the world's population reside in areas exceeding the current World Health Organization's Air Quality Guidelines of 5 micro-grams per meter cubed. 
Estimated exposures from the model are combined with risk estimates to produce a global assessment of exposures to PM2.5 and to estimate the associated burden of disease attributable to air pollution.EndFragment</div>

		<div>DATA INTEGRATION MODEL FOR AIR QUALITY (DIMAQ)</div>
		<div>The Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ)  was developed by the WHO Data Integration Task Force to integrate data from multiple sources in order to provide global estimates of exposures to PM2.5 at high spatial resolution in order to calculate country-level burden of disease.The primary source of information for estimating exposures has been measurements from ground monitoring networks but, although coverage is increasing, there remain regions in which monitoring is limited. Ground monitoring data therefore needs to be supplemented with information from other sources, such as satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and chemical transport models. 

A hierarchical modelling approach for integrating data from multiple sources is proposed allowing spatially-varying relationships between ground measurements and other factors that estimate air quality. Set within a Bayesian framework, the resulting Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) is used to estimate exposures, together with associated measures of uncertainty, on a high-resolution grid covering the entire world. 
Modelled exposure to PM2.5 provides more comprehensive exposure information for countries than measured data that provide data only for a selection of towns and cities. A comprehensive set of estimated exposures such as this will be required when estimating the health impacts of ambient air pollution for a country. 

The DIMAQ model calibrates data from these sources with ground measurements. The relationships between the different sources of data may be complex and will vary between regions due to differences in the composition of PM2.5 and other factors. Within DIMAQ, these relationships are expressed in terms of a series of calibration equations which are allowed to change over space. DIMAQ has a hierarchical structure that uses individual country’s data, where available.
In the most recent version of DIMAQ, where there is sufficient data, calibration equations can vary both within and between countries but where there is insufficient data within a country, to produce accurate equations, the equations that relate ground measurements to the other variables are contrusting by ‘borrowing’ information from the wider region. 
When calibration equations have been established and tested, the model is used to estimate exposures, together with associated measures of the uncertainty, across the globe. These high-resolution estimates of PM2.5 can be used to produce air quality profiles for individual countries, regions and globally.  Further to this, by defining areas as either urban or rural (based on land-use, derived from satellite images, and population estimates) at a resolution to match the estimates of air pollution from DIMAQ, the profiles can presented  separately for urban and rural areas. 
DIMAQ is used to calculate SDG indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)
